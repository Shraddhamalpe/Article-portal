This repository contains a full stack Article Portal application developed using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express and MongoDB for the backend. The project allows users to view original articles as well as updated articles fetched dynamically from a database through REST APIs.

For local setup, first clone the repository to your system and navigate into the project directory. Install backend dependencies using npm install inside the backend folder. Create a .env file and configure the required environment variables such as the port number and MongoDB connection string. Start the backend server using node server.js, which will run on http://localhost:5000. Next, move to the frontend folder, install dependencies using npm install, and start the React application with npm start. The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000 and will communicate with the backend to fetch and display articles and live link of project  https://shraddhamalpe.github.io/Article-portal/

The application follows a simple and clear data flow architecture. User requests originate from the browser and are handled by the React frontend components. These components use Axios to make API calls to the Express backend. The backend processes the request, interacts with the MongoDB database using Mongoose, retrieves the article data, and sends it back to the frontend. The frontend then renders the original and updated articles on the user interface.

A live version of the frontend application is also deployed and accessible via the provided URL, where reviewers can directly verify the functionality by viewing both the original and updated articles as stored in the database. This live link demonstrates the end-to-end working of the project, including frontend UI, backend APIs, and database integration.
